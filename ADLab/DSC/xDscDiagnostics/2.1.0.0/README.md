# xDscDiagnostics

The **xDscDiagnostics** module contains two cmdlets for analyzing DSC event logs and identifying the causes of any failure in a DSC operation: **Get-xDscOperation** and **Trace-xDscOperation**.

## Contributing
Please check out common DSC Resources [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Kit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Description

The **xDscDiagnostics** module exposes two primary functions--**Get-xDscOperation** and **Trace-xDscOperation**--and one helper function--**Update-xDscEventLogStatus**--that aid in diagnosing DSC errors. Here, we use the term DSC operation to indicate the execution of any DSC cmdlet from its start to its end. For instance, Start-DscConfiguration and Test-DscConfiguration would form two separate DSC operations. The cmdlets also let you diagnose operations run on other computers. More details about their usage is given below in the Details section.

## Install the module

## Cmdlets

### Get-xDscOperation
This cmdlet lists statuses of the last few run DSC operations.
It returns an object that has information about the time that operation was created, whether the operation was successful or not, a handle to all the events generated by that operation, and the unique job identifier for that operation.
(Read [this blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2014/01/03/using-event-logs-to-diagnose-errors-in-desired-state-configuration.aspx) to understand the role of the job ID in DSC events.)
The cmdlet accepts the following parameters: 
* **Newest**: Number of past operations you want to output.
By default, it will display details of the last 10 operations
* **ComputerName**: Name of the computer from which you'd like to collect the event diagnostic details.
The input can be an array of strings.
You would need to execute the command `New-NetFirewallRule -Name "Service RemoteAdmin" -Action Allow` on the remote computer in order to execute this operation on it.
* **Credential**: Credentials required to access the computer given in the ComputerName property

### Trace-xDscOperation 
Once we run Get-xDscOperation, we can see which of the operations were a failure/success. 
Also, we can note a correlation between SequenceID and JobID for each operation. 
Trace-xDscOperation takes either of these values as parameters and gives you a readable list of events generated by their respective DSC operation.
By default, Trace-xDscOperation will list all the events generated by the most recent DSC operation.
This cmdlet returns an object that contains properties such as event type, event message, and time of event creation.
The cmdlet accepts the following parameters: 
* **SequenceID**: This is a field present in the object returned from running Get-xDscOperation. 
It identifies an operation run in the computer.
By specifying the sequence ID, all the events pertaining to the corresponding operation are returned.
* **JobID**: This is a GUID that is a prefix to all the events published by DSC, which uniquely identifies each operation.
It is also a field present in the object returned from running Get-xDscOperation cmdlet.
By specifying a JobID, this cmdlet will extract and display all events pertaining to the corresponding DSC operation.
* **ComputerName**: Name of the computer from which you'd like to collect the event diagnostic details.
The input can be an array of strings.
You would need to execute the command `New-NetFirewallRule -Name "Service RemoteAdmin" -Action Allow` on the remote computer(s) in order to execute this operations on it.
* **Credential**: Credentials required to access the computer given in the ComputerName property.

### Update-xDscEventLogStatus
This cmdlet helps us enable or disable any of the DSC event logs.
When the cmdlets Get-xDscOperation and Set-xDscOperation are used, they will output details from events generated in the enabled channels.
If the channel is disabled, a warning is issued on the PowerShell console.
By using the cmdlet Update-xDscEventLogStatus, you could enable the channel required to collect DSC events.
* **Channel**: This is a mandatory parameter that indicates which DSC channel status needs to be updated: { Analytic | Debug | Operational }
* **Status**: This is a mandatory parameter that indicates the final state of the channel: { Enabled | Disabled }
* **ComputerName**: Name of the computer on which you would like to set the log status.
You would need to execute the command `New-NetFirewallRule -Name "Service RemoteAdmin" -Action Allow` on the remote computer(s) in order to execute this operations on it.
* **Credential**: Credentials required to access the computer given in the ComputerName property.

### Get-xDscDiagnosticsZip
This cmdlet generates a zip of DSC and DSC Extension diagnostics to send to support.
The output will be the name of the zip file.
The cmdlet will confirm by default.
* **Session**: This is an optional parameter of a PSSession to use to collect the diagnostics
			
## Versions

### Unreleased

### 2.1.0.0

### 2.0.0.0

* Release with bug fixes and the following cmdlets 
    * Get-xDscOperation

    * Update-xDscEventLogStatus

### 1.0.0.0

* Initial release with the following cmdlets 
    * Get-xDscOperation
    * Trace-xDscOperation


## Examples

### Display the status of last 20 DSC operations

This example will list the last 20 DSC operations to see if any of them failed.

```powershell 
Get-xDscOperation -Newest 20
```

### Display the status of the last two DSC operations in computer XXYY after passing Credential $cred

This example lets you find the status of DSC operations run on another computer. *Note: this requires a credential.*

```powershell
Get-xDscOperation -ComputerName Temp-Computer.domain.com -Credential $cred -Newest 2
```

### Trace a DSC operation that has a specific job ID

This example displays all events generated by the DSC operation that was assigned a particular unique job ID. 

```powershell
Trace-xDscOperation -JobId aa6b4f3e-53f9-4f02-a502-26028e7531ca
```

### Get events of the second to last operation run on the localhost machine

This example displays a list of events and their messages published by the DSC operation run second to last (i.e. the sequence ID assigned to it is 2).

```powershell
Trace-xDscOperation -SequenceId 2 -ComputerName localhost
```

### Get diagnostic events of operations run on multiple computers that use the same credential

This example displays the list of events and their messages from multiple computers, as long as the credential passed works for all of them.

```powershell
Get-xDscOperation -ComputerName localhost, tempcomputer.domain.com -Credential $cred
```

### Enable the DSC Analytic event log

This example shows how you can enable the DSC Analytic channel event log. 
By default, this channel is disabled.
By using this cmdlet, you can enable the channel collect all DSC events using the other 2 xDscDiagnostics cmdlets.

```powershell
Update-xDscEventLogStatus -Channel Analytic -Status Enabled
```
